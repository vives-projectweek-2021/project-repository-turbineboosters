# TurbineBoosters
Welcome to our project repository!

To create our windturbine we had to make some choices. The first choice we had to make was wich motor to use as generator.
It soon became clear to us that we had to use a 3 phasse BLDC motor.
We looked around at our options and had 2 motors available, one that generates around 60V:

and another one that generates only around 6V, but has more power:

We decided to go for the motor that generates 60V because we lose 1,4V across the diodes of our 3 phase bridge rectifier and that leaves us with an efficiency of 96%, while the other motor would only offer us an efficiency of about 77%.
