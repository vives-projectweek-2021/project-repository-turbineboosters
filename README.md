# TurbineBoosters
Welcome to our project repository!

To create our windturbine we had to make some choices. The first choice we had to make was wich motor we could use best as generator.
It soon became clear to us that we had to use a 3 phasse BLDC motor.
We looked around at our options and had 2 motors available, one generates around 60V:

and the other one generates only around 6V but has more power:

We decided to go for the motor that generates 60V because we lose 1,4V across the diodes of our 3 phase bridge rectifier and that leaves us with an efficiency of 96%, with to other motor our efficiency would only be 77%.
