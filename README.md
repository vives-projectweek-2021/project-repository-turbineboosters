## Choice of motor

To create our windturbine we had to make some choices. The first choice we had to make was wich motor to use as generator.
It soon became clear to us that we had to use a 3 phasse BLDC motor.
We looked around at our options and had 2 motors available, one that generates around 60V:

and another one that generates only around 6V, but has more power:

We decided to go for the motor that generates 60V because we lose 1,4V across the diodes of our 3 phase bridge rectifier and that leaves us with an efficiency of 96%, while the other motor would only offer us an efficiency of about 77%.


## Rectifier + first LoRa module

The power generated by our motor is fed to a 3 phase bridge rectifier:

On this board we measure the current and voltage via a shunt-resistor of 0,5â„¦.
The LoRa module (RN2483A) receives this data and sends it peer-to-peer to another LoRa module:





## Mechanical design

We mount a bicycle wheel on the shaft of our motor, to which we mount 8 PVC-blades via 3D-printed coupling pieces.
